# CameraProject

Camera project is based on camera security system.In this project,we 
are using IP camera, and RTSP to receive stream 
and convert it to visual format and going to store into database.In the 
further working we'll be providing authenticity to users such as how one 
can view the video from the database.We'll maintain the frame storage 
speed of the camera in order to save the memory.To 
convert Stream,Motion is a good option which support multiple cameras at 
the same time,open source.
 It is developed for Linux and is able to detect if a significant part 
of the picture has changed saving away video when it detects that motion 
is occurring.
